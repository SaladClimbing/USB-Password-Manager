# USB-Password-Manager
This is a password manager that is meant to run on an esp32 board, utilizing a tft display and a rotary dial for interface. Rotate through your saved passwords and then click to have them typed out on the computer it's plugged into. **NOTE: I WOULD NOT TRUST THIS WITH ANY SENSITIVE PASSWORDS, THIS IS MEARLY A FUN PROJECT AND LACKS SERIOUS ENCRYPTION. PLEASE USE AT YOUR OWN RISK WITH COMPUTERS YOU TRUST**

## How to make yourself
This is the hardware I'm using, however there shouldn't be anything special about my equipment and you should be able to use many different options. However if you still wish to use the exact same specs, here is what I have along with links:
The board that I am using is [the Adafruit Esp32-S3 Reverse TFT Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5691) due to the small package and since it has 2/3 hardware requirements built in.
The rotary encoder is also from Adafruit and is [this I2C board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4991).
I used the Stemma QT ports however there is nothing special that makes Stemma QT a requirement

If you'd like to contribute, please do, fork and submit a pull request. Please please please, label your changes well both in your pull request and do not leave your code confusing and commentless. Github is also not very intuitive to me and I'm very new to the whole process so please bear with me, and notify me if I did anything wrong.
